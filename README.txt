I did not modify much code for this assignment, using the base from BURLAP. I changed some of the code to modify the MDPs and the exploration strategies for Q-learning. The modified code can be found at https://github.com/sgadgil6/CS4641-Markov-Decision-Processes

To implement the algorithms, Brown-UMBC Reinforcement Learning and Planning (BURLAP) was used, which is a java code library containing planning algorithms. The website is http://burlap.cs.brown.edu/ and the github repository is https://github.com/jmacglashan/burlap. 

For this analysis, an extension of the BURLAP was used, with support for getting analysis results. It is written by juanjose49 and can be found at the github repository https://github.com/juanjose49/omscs-cs7641-machine-learning-assignment-4. 

Installation and Running the code (Taken from juanjose49's README) :
1) Clone or download the repository https://github.com/sgadgil6/CS4641-Markov-Decision-Processes.
2) Download and install IntelliJ/Eclipse IDE.
3) Import the project inside of Eclipse/Intellij.
4) Navigate through context menu to Maven, then click Update Project to create the project as a Maven project. This should resolve classpath issues. Note: if you're having issues related to the classpath, or import/dependency issues try to repeat steps 4 and 5.

The /plots directory contains the excel files created with the values and plots used in the analysis.
